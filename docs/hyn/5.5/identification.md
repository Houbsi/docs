During runtime, the `Environment` class is bound into Laravel's container. The
tenancy environment holds one single responsibility, which is telling our code
what `hostname` is currently identified and resolving the related website.

# Early identification

By default Tenancy will identify the tenant after all Middleware has been processed.
You can resolve the Environment class through the service container
inside a middleware to force identification of the tenant early on. If you want the 
package to handle this on your behalf you can enable the `early-identification` flag in
 your `tenancy.php` configuration file under `hostname`.

# Manual identification

The environment can be used to manually set any active tenant. This is one of the
reasons why the tenancy configuration file has the `hostname > auto-identification`
setting. Turn it off to implement your own tenancy identification.

Manual identification is pretty straightforward. Take for example the following
snippet for a custom (app) service provider:

```php
public function boot()
{
    $environment = $this->app->make(\Hyn\Tenancy\Environment::class);

    // Retrieve your website

    // Now switch the environment to a new tenant.
    $environment->tenant($website);
}
```

> Be wary about switching tenants. It is recommend switching only once during code
execution. Use a background job to run mass changes on tenant databases.

# Retrieve current tenant

To work with the current environment, you can do the following:

```php
 
 // Get current Website (Tenant)
 $website   = \Hyn\Tenancy\Facades\TenancyFacade::website();
 
 // prefered option
 $website   = app(\Hyn\Tenancy\Environment::class)->tenant();
 
 // alternative (outdated) 
 $website   = app(\Hyn\Tenancy\Environment::class)->website();
 
 $websiteId = $website->id;
 
 // Get current Hostname
 $hostname  = app(\Hyn\Tenancy\Environment::class)->hostname();
 
 // Get FQDN (Fully-Qualified Domain Name) by current hostname
 $fqdn      = $hostname->fqdn;

 
```
